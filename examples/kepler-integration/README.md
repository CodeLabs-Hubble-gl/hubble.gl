# Demo App

This is a lite version of the kepler.gl demo app that includes hubble.gl features. In particular, presets to modify zoom, bearing, pitch, as well as latitude/longitude are demonstrated within a self-contained modal that can be accessed by clicking the "Export" button. Afterwards, animations can be exported in various formats such as GIF, WEBM, JPEG sequence, etc.
